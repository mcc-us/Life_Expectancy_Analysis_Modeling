    "In 2006, The World Health Organization published a report entitled `Preventing disease through healthy environments`.\n",
    ">[It] “confirms that approximately one-quarter of the global disease burden, and more than one-third of the burden among children, is due to modifiable environmental factors.” \n",

    "Not all data features are complete. There are approximately 20+ countries that need more information. Many of these countries are currently in civil unrest or outright war.\n",
